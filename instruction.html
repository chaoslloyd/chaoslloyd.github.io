            <p><strong>Directions to Ross' Studio:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Ross' studio is at 3306 Clays Mill Rd, Suite 104, which is right
              across the street from Jesse Clark Middle School. If you're going
              out of town on Clays Mill, it will be on your left. From the
              entrance off of Clays Mill, 3306 is the leftmost of the two
              identical office buildings on the grounds. Once you enter the
              parking lot, you will be looking at the back (or "employee
              entrance") of the buildings. Go around to the other side and look
              for Suite 104, which is marked as Alliance Assurance. This is one
              of two entrances to the suite, and my studio is accessed through
              the other, unmarked door to the left of the marked door. I'm in
              room B3.
